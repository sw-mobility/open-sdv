## **How Can I Contribute?**

### **1. Reporting Bugs**

- **Expected and actual results**
- **Screenshots or logs** (if applicable)
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, dependencies, etc.)

This information helps us diagnose and resolve the issue more quickly.

### **2. Suggesting Enhancements**
We’re always looking for ways to improve! If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, please [open a feature request](https://github.com/sw-mobility/SDV_AIFW/issues) and provide:
- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Problem you’re trying to solve**
- **Proposed solution** (if applicable)
- **Any alternative solutions you’ve considered**

We’ll review and discuss your proposal to see how it fits into the project’s goals.

### **3. Submitting Code Changes**
If you’d like to contribute code, please follow these steps:
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork** locally (`git clone https://github.com/your-username/sw-mobility/SDV_AIFW.git`)
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
4. **Run tests** to ensure everything works (`npm test`, `pytest`, etc.)
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`)
6. **Push your branch** to your fork (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`)
7. **Create a pull request** from your branch to `main` or `dev` (as specified by the project maintainers)

Be sure to reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #1234`) in your pull request description.

## **Development Workflow**

Here’s a quick overview of our workflow:
1. **Work on a feature branch**. Never work directly on `main`.
2. **Submit pull requests** to merge changes into `main` or `dev`.
3. **Wait for review and feedback**. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers and other contributors.
4. **Address requested changes**. If changes are requested, update your pull request.
5. **Get approval and merge**. Once approved, your changes will be merged!
